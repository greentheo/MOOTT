x-add in another table into config for valid pickup points...specify which are valid dropoff poitns for the pickup (all or a subset)
x-and a table that shows the pickup-dropoff pairs (editable)
x-and a table that shows the pickup-baseStation pairs (editable)
x - add in a column for the dropoff point in the dispatchQueue
-gerrymander an aha moment into the data and the demo (the big "I want one!" moment)
-Rod's ahas .... 
-- parking lot location (are they in the right position... or given a set of lots which trucks should go there)
-- better operations with a forecast and help in the dispatch according to multi objectives 
-- it all goes to hell when they have to reallocate when resources change...dynamic reallocation... system interrupt recovery

-if we are telling a story with it we need some canned data (maybe create a couple of pre-routed and dispatched results so that we don't have to wait for it to dispatch)

-what's the story?


TODO:
====

-manual reassignment of load
-manual change of load to dropoff point
-manual change of drop off point availability
-manual change of truck availability
-truck alternatives calculations
-base station optimizer (kmeans... this should be easy actually)


Further TODO

-dynamic creation of new dropoff points
-creation of new pickup requests to be filled
-parking lot analysis ... which trucks should be at which base (can't really demo this though until we have real data...or we make up fake data)
- 


Even later TODO
-multi stop
