This document tests out all of the funcitonality and reports on what results from the function calls.  

Helps to test out which parts of the code might not be working.

### Base Data Generation

```{r}
library(DPSOpenCPU)
library(knitr)


demoData = baseData()

demoData

```

### Dispatching

```{r}

dispatch = dispatchQueue(demoData,windowsAhead = 12)



### make a plot of the dispatch locations



### summary tables
dispatchSummary = dispatchSummaries(dispatch = dispatch, baseData = demoData)

### summary metrics
dispatchMetrics = dispatchBriefSummary(dispatchSummary = dispatchSummary, baseData = demoData)


```


### Modifying the base data and assumptions


### Modifying the queue, pickups and dynamically rescheduling the dispatch
